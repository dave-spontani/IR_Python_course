################################Assignment number one: Basic Python ##################################################

##########Task Number one: Create a variable containing a string that is a number (e.g "9"). Cast the string as an integer



##########Task Number two: Now, take that number and multiply it with any integer above 5 - save the 
######### result in a variable named "multiplied"



##########Task Number three: Create an empty list, then use a for-loop to fill the list with all the numbers leading up 
######## to the number you created in "multiplied" (use "range()" and "append()"). Be sure to include 0!



##########Task number four: Now do the same, but using a list comprehension 



##########Task number five: Generate a list of letters from the alphabet (e.b ["a", "b", "c"...] etc.) that has the 
######## same length as the list of numbers you created in Task three (use List slicing for this) if the length of the
######## numbers list is below 26. Otherwise, Slice the numbers list to have as many elements as letters in the alphabet




#########Task number six: Now that both lists are of the same length, write a double for-loop that prints out all elements 
######## from both lists in the following format: a0, b0, c0 ..... a1, b1, c1.....



####Extra credit
#########Task number seven: Since you have both lists, we could write a dictionary that shows the position of a letter
######## in the alphabet. Create an empty dict, then use a for-loop to populate it with the number as the key and the
######## corresponding letter as the value, so e.g: 0 maps to "a", 1 maps to b etc,. Write it in five lines of code and 
######## then print out the result that should look like this: {0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c', 3: 'd'.....}
