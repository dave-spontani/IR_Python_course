##################Code exercise: Speed dating
##################We will write a mixer for two groups of people so they can get to know each other 
#########Exercise 1: 
# Write a list containing seven male names, and a list containing seven female names. Call the male names group_a and the female names
# group_b

# We want these two groups of people to mix with. Write a function that randomly assigns the people into pairs by randomly picking a 
# person from group A and one from goup B and saving the result in a dictionary. Do this until all people are paired up with a person from 
# the other group!

########Exercise 2: Since the two people won't know each other, we can help them by telling them what they should wear so they 
# can recognize each other. Create a list of colours and create a similar dictionary as in Exercise 1, but this time the person 
# who is the key should give back a list as it's value, where the first element is the name of the person and the second element
# is the colour that person should wear.
