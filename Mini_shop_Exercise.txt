#####################Code exercise: Mini-Mart/Mini Shop
###We will create a pandas dataframe which contains the sales data of your own little Shop
###You are free to build it however you please! However, the data must be random, and you will have to meet the following requirements:
#0. All figures must be plausible
#1. A minimum of 5 columns is required: Of these 5, one column must contain the date of the sale;
#   and another column must contain the purchaser/customer (of which you are to have at the least 10 different customers). Finally, 
#   one column must contain a unique identifyer 
#2. A minimum of 10'000 entries/rows is required

#To ensure that the random results can be replicated, run the following command at the beginning of the file:
#"random.seed(10)"
